# TETRIS - Website Game

## Control
`W` `A` `S` `D` or `↑` `←` `↓` `→`

## Points accrual
The number of points depends on how many lines are cleared at one time:
* 1 line - 100 points
* 2 lines - 300 points
* 3 lines - 700 points
* 4 lines (make Tetris) - 1500 points

## Complexity
For every 10 times the lines removed (1-4 lines can be removed for 1 time), the delay is reduced by <b>7%</b>.
So, the more lines you removed at time, the higher chance of you winning ;)

The initial delay is <b>700 ms</b>. 
Minimum delay - <b>300 ms</b>.
